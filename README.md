# Machine Learning Algorithm Implementations 🏆  
*Core implementations for CyberLabs Competition + Extended PyTorch Models*

---

## 🚨 Competition Submissions (CyberLabs)  
**Algorithms Built from Scratch** (using **only NumPy/Pandas** as per competition rules):  
- **Linear Regression**  
- **Polynomial Regression**  
- **Logidtic Regression**  
- **K-means Clustering**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **N-Layer Neural Network (KNN)**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

## 🧪 Extended Implementations (Post-Competition)  
Added **PyTorch-based models** for deeper exploration:  
1. **RNN & LSTM**:  
   - Task: Predict next token in synthetic sine wave sequences.  
   - Dataset: Synthetically Generated sine waves .  
2. **Trigram Model**:  
   - Task: Text generation using probability smoothing.  
   - Dataset: `nltk.corpus.brown` .
